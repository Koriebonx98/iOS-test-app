Hello, I’m Korie — a UI‑driven developer and systems designer who specialises in building console‑style environments, developer tools, and secure, data‑driven platforms.

My work focuses on creating polished, responsive interfaces and OS‑layer experiences that feel cohesive, intuitive, and fast. I design systems that go beyond traditional web development — environments that behave like full platforms, complete with navigation frameworks, user profiles, settings layers, plugin support, and secure distribution models.

Over the past few years, I’ve built a collection of interconnected projects that demonstrate my approach to engineering:

• PS5 OS — a full OS‑layer environment with a login screen, settings system, quick menu, controller navigation, plugin architecture, auto‑launch mode, and shell‑replacement capability.
• Game OS — a Windows‑based launcher and media/game manager with drive‑scanning logic, custom UI components, and a console‑style UX.
• AppStore — a secure, JSON‑driven software distribution platform that links directly to GitHub repositories for transparent, malware‑resistant installation and updates.
• iOS Test App — a mobile‑first web application that serves as my interactive CV, portfolio, and live demonstration of my UI and front‑end capabilities.
• BBC iPlayer Desktop App — a custom media playback environment with a bespoke UI.
• Playnite Tools — automation scripts, metadata utilities, and launcher integrations.


Across all of these projects, I’ve focused on UI/UX design, system architecture, multi‑platform compatibility, and secure, transparent distribution. I use modern development tools — including AI‑assisted workflows — to rapidly prototype, refine, and ship features. Every project is directed, structured, and architected by me, from the logic and data models to the user experience and visual design.

My strengths include:

• Front‑end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
• UI/UX systems and responsive design
• C#/WPF desktop application development
• JSON‑driven interfaces and data modelling
• App ecosystems, launchers, and OS‑layer environments
• Secure, repo‑based software distribution
• Controller‑driven navigation
• Multi‑platform design (Windows, Linux, macOS via Wine/Proton)
• Rapid learning and iterative development


I’m passionate about building experiences that feel smooth, cohesive, and thoughtfully designed — whether that’s a web interface, a desktop environment, or a full OS‑layer system. I’m now looking for an opportunity to bring this mindset to a team where I can contribute to real products, collaborate with experienced developers, and continue growing as a front‑end and platform engineer.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
