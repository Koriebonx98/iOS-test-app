Hello, I’m Korie — a UI-driven developer and systems designer with a focus on building console-style environments, developer tools, and secure, data-driven platforms.

I specialise in crafting polished, responsive interfaces and OS-layer experiences that are cohesive, intuitive, and fast. My systems go beyond traditional web development — I create full platform-like environments featuring navigation frameworks, user profiles, settings layers, plugin support, and secure distribution models.

Over the past few years, I’ve developed a suite of interconnected projects that reflect my engineering philosophy:

• PS5 OS — a complete OS-layer environment featuring a login screen, settings system, quick menu, controller navigation, plugin architecture, auto-launch mode, and shell-replacement capability.
• Game OS — a Windows-based launcher and media/game manager with drive-scanning logic, custom UI components, and a console-style UX.
• AppStore — a secure, JSON-driven software distribution platform that integrates directly with GitHub repositories for transparent, malware-resistant installation and updates.
• iOS Test App — a mobile-first web application that serves as my interactive CV, portfolio, and live demonstration of my UI and front-end capabilities.
• BBC iPlayer Desktop App — a custom media playback environment with a bespoke UI.
• Playnite Tools — automation scripts, metadata utilities, and launcher integrations.

Throughout these projects, I’ve emphasised UI/UX design, system architecture, multi-platform compatibility, and secure, transparent distribution. I leverage modern development tools — including AI-assisted workflows — to rapidly prototype, iterate, and deliver features. Every project is fully directed, structured, and architected by me, from logic and data models to user experience and visual design.

My core strengths include:

• Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
• UI/UX systems and responsive design
• C#/WPF desktop application development
• JSON-driven interfaces and data modelling
• App ecosystems, launchers, and OS-layer environments
• Secure, repo-based software distribution
• Controller-driven navigation
• Multi-platform design (Windows, Linux, macOS via Wine/Proton)
• Rapid learning and iterative development

I’m passionate about building experiences that feel smooth, cohesive, and thoughtfully designed — whether it’s a web interface, a desktop environment, or a full OS-layer system. I’m now seeking an opportunity to bring this mindset to a team where I can contribute to real products, collaborate with experienced developers, and continue growing as a front-end and platform engineer.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
